        <h1>Hello World_</h1>
        <p class='AboutParargraph'>
            I realised I could write codes when I was asked to develop software as an intern at CREATION.co, a firm that supports pharmaceutical companies with market research.

            We often had to create sets of more than 1,000 slides to report research findings, 
            so my task was to solve this problem by developing legacy code that would reduce 6 weeks of work to 10 minutes.
            As the code grew longer, there were countless new ways for errors to occur, but I refused to be discouraged. 
            In the end, my code generated a report close to 60% of the standard reports made by humans.

            It's my discovery: I could actually create stuff.
            Founds And Coders can offer theories and practical skills that I need to become a good founder.
